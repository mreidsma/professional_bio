## My bio for conferences, speaking engagements, and publications:

### Short bio:

### Longer bio:

Matthew Reidsma is the Web Services Librarian at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan. He is the co-founder and Editor-in-Chief of [*Weave: Journal of Library User Experience*](http://weaveux.org), a peer-reviewed, open access journal for Library User Experience professionals. He is the author of *Responsive Web Design for Libraries* published by ALA TechSource and *Customing Library Systems Tools for Better UX* from Libraries Unlimited. He speaks about library websites, user experience, and usability around the world. *Library Journal* named him a “Mover and Shaker” in 2013, which led to many unfortunate dance-related jokes in the Reidsma household. He writes about libraries and technology at [matthewreidsma.com](http://matthewreidsma.com).
