# READ ME

This is just a repo to hold things I get asked for a lot in my professional life: my bio and photos for conferences, speaking engagements, and publications. Although it could be construed as a bucket of vanity, I like to think of it as a way for me to keep my professional identity consistent across time.

I have 2 image options:

1. Reidsma_sm and Reidsma_lg are large and small images of a photo of me. I have options in high and low resolution available as PNG files.
2. Reidsma_alt is a caricature of me. I tend to use this one, but I know it weirds some folks out. If that's you, then feel free to use the other options. This is available as a JPEG.

You can find written bios in short and long versions in the [professional_bio.markdown](professional_bio.markdown) file.
